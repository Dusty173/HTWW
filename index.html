    <h1>How the Web Works Excersize</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Part One:</h2>
        <p>1: HTTP is a protocol that retrieves and sends data to a database/server. it stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</p>
        <p>2: A URL is an address for any internet resource, it stands for Uinform Resource Locator</p>
        <p>3: A DNS or Domain Name System, is basically the phonebook of the internet. A browser will translate the domain name to its respective IP address.</p>
        <p>4: A query string is part of the URL which accesses a specific file based on the parameter passed in.</p>
        <p>5: Two HTTP verbs (or Methods) are: <br> GET: Retrieves data from a database or server <br> POST: sends data to be saved to the database or server.</p>
        <p>6: An HTTTP request is made when the client/browser needs to access information from an outside source.</p>
        <p>7: An HTTP response is the response from a server after a client/browser requested it and it contains any HTML/CSS/JS/etc. that is included.</p>
        <p>8: An HTTP header is part of the HTTP request/response that includes any additional context or metadata about the request/response.<br> Request examples are: Accept-Language, Accept. Response examples are: Set-cookie, Last-Modified.</p>
        <p>9: The Proccesses are: Browser goes to DNS server, Retrieves IP's, Browser sends HTTP request to server, server responds with requested and relavent resources,<br>The browser takes the response and parses it into a DOM and if any additional resources are required the browser will make more HTTP requests to those resources.</p>
